# R Workshop
Welcome to the Github repository of the R workshop created by [Mathijs de Jong](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mathijsdejong995/). This workshop was originally designed for a coding hours session hosted by Turing Students Rotterdam and has since been used for multiple iterations of the [EFR/ESE job market skills week](https://www.efr.nl/education/efrese-job-market-skills) and the EUR Career Skills Week.
